  <p>My name is Kelvon Agee. I am a Producer, Director, and Director of Photography (DP) specializing in capturing authentic narratives through a cinematic lens. For over 10 years, I have built my career in documentary storytelling, working on projects such as Deadliest Catch, Sprint: World’s Fastest Humans, Maritime Masters: Expedition Antarctica, Swamp People, World's Toughest Race: Eco-Challenge Fiji, and Life Below Zero. My work totals over 200 produced and 130 directed hours of prime-time programming, garnering 5 Primetime Emmy nominations for Cinematography.</p>
  <p>I have also shot a wide range of campaigns, ads, and organic content for clients such as NBA legend Chris Paul, multi-Grammy award-winning superstar Seal (Leica), luxury skin boutique Cotrini Beauty, The Dick Butkus Award (Big 10 Network), and global tech leader Logitech.</p>
  <p>My personal mission is to authentically bring your story to the screen and tell the narratives that need to be shared. As a creative, problem solver, and leader, I always push my clients and colleagues alike to create dynamic, purposeful content—while having fun along the way.</p>
